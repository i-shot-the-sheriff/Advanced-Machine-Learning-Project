## About the Project
This repository contains our final work for the Advanced Machine Learning course at ENSAE, Institut Polytechnique de Paris.

In this repository, you will find the following files:
* A notebook (.ipynb), explaining in more depth our modeling approaches. This notebook contains the main results.

If you want to run the notebook from your computer, you will need to clone this repository (see below for the corresponding command line instruction).

The IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection database which we used in this project is available for access at the following link [public website]([https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/discussion/100662)). 

We would also like to thank Professor Austin J. Stromme for the support and knowledge they gave us.
